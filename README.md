Library Management System is a backend application built using Java and Spring Boot that provides REST APIs to manage books, users, and book issue/return operations. The system checks book availability before issuing, stores issue and due dates, and calculates fines for late returns using the Java Date-Time API. It uses Spring Data JPA for database interaction, maintains proper entity relationships, and includes global exception handling for error scenarios. The project focuses on clean backend design, real-world business logic, and database persistence.
